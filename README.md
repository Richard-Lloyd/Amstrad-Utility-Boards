Amstrad CPC expansion cards originally came with an edge connector to plug in the back of the computer. For a number of years now, backplane expanders have been available that accommodate pin/socket header connectors that are much more reliable. This PCB can adapt a card with an edge connector to allow it to utilise one of the backplane expanders. Also, some cards with an edge connector don't allow through connections and prevent anything else being fitted. This PCB can be used to connect 'edge connector' cards to an expansion backplane in a numbers of ways to avoid this problem.
