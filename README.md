## 1. Amstrad CPC 50way PCB Edge to Pin/Socket Header Convertor
Work in progress.

Amstrad CPC expansion cards originally came with an edge connector to plug in the back of the computer. For a number of years now, backplane expanders have been available that accommodate pin/socket header connectors that are much more reliable. This PCB can adapt a card with an edge connector to allow it to utilise one of the backplane expanders. Also, some cards with an edge connector don't allow through connections and prevent anything else being fitted. This PCB can be used to connect 'edge connector' cards to an expansion backplane in a numbers of ways to avoid this problem.

|Config No|Description|Notes|
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Direct Edge to MX4 | Used where the card edge connector is parallel to it's card and will sit vertically |
| 2 | Indirect Edge to MX4 | Used where the card edge connector is at right angles to it's card or the card is bulky. A 50 way ribbon cable extension allows the card to be a distance from the MX4 connector. Can be used to connect the DDI-1 interface to an MX4 expansion backplane. |
| 3 | Indirect edge to MX4 'through' | Uses the through connector on an expansion backplane as a card connector. Same user case as 2 but uses a female instead of a male connector. |
