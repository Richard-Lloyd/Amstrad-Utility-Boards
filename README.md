## 1. Amstrad CPC 50way PCB Edge to Pin/Socket Header Convertor
Work in progress.

Amstrad CPC expansion cards originally came with an edge connector to plug into the back of the computer. For a number of years now, backplane expanders have been available that accommodate pin/socket header connectors that are much more reliable. This PCB can be used to create adaptors for cards with an edge connector to allow them to utilise one of the backplane expanders. Also some cards, with an edge connector, don't allow through connections and prevent anything else being fitted. This PCB can be used to create adaptors that connect 'edge connector' cards to an expansion backplane in a numbers of ways to avoid these problems.

Please note.
1. The PCBs can be ordered (usually in batches of 10) from a number of manufacturers.
2. You will need to obtain suitable connectors and cable for the configurations you intend to build.
3. You will need soldering skills and the ability to 'crimp' IDC connectors for two of the configurations.
4. Some cards may not work properly due to the extra resistance of the connectors and cable added by these adaptors.
5. There are no electronic devices so these adaptors are easy to build.

|Config No|Description|Notes|
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Direct Edge to MX4 | Used where the card edge connector is parallel to it's card and will sit vertically |
| 2 | Indirect Edge to MX4 | Used where the card edge connector is at right angles to it's card or the card is bulky. A 50 way ribbon cable extension allows the card to be a distance from the MX4 connector. Can be used to connect the DDI-1 interface to an MX4 expansion backplane. |
| 3 | Indirect edge to MX4 'through' | Uses the through connector on an expansion backplane as a card connector. Same user case as 2 but uses a female instead of a male connector. |
